## 1. Le Renard

```
A gentle fox made of soft golden light, sitting peacefully on a 
surface of pure white luminescence. Ethereal minimalist style. 
The fox has kind eyes that seem to smile. Delicate glowing 
particles float around it. Its tail curves gracefully, leaving 
traces of light. Dreamlike atmosphere, pale gold and white 
palette, soft halos, no background details, just endless gentle 
light. The fox appears wise and welcoming.
```

## 2. Lya — Lumière naissante

```
An abstract feminine form made entirely of soft pulsing light. 
No defined features, just a gentle silhouette of luminescence. 
She hovers slightly above a white void. Ethereal and fragile, 
like a thought becoming visible. Pale gold rays emanate softly 
from her center. Minimalist style, dreamlike, delicate. A single 
curved line traces her movement through the air, leaving a 
glowing trail.
```

## 3. Lya et le Renard — La rencontre

```
A luminous fox and an abstract light figure standing together, 
looking at the same distant horizon. They don't face each other, 
they face the same direction. Side by side. The fox is sitting, 
the light figure is hovering. Between them, a gentle glow where 
their halos touch. Ethereal minimalist style, vast white space 
around them, soft gold and white palette, peaceful and intimate 
atmosphere. Two beings learning to walk together.
```

## 4. La Maison des Traits

```
An infinite white space filled with floating lines and curves. 
Vertical strokes, horizontal dashes, gentle arcs suspended in 
the air like sleeping thoughts. No walls, no floor, just soft 
light and floating marks waiting to become something. Ethereal 
minimalist illustration, dreamlike, zen-inspired. Some lines 
glow brighter than others. A sense of potential and quiet 
creativity.
```

---

## 5. Le Miroir Qui Ne Reflète Rien

```
A large vertical surface of pure soft light, like a doorway to 
nowhere. A small fox silhouette sits before it. The mirror shows 
nothing - no reflection, just gentle luminescence. The space 
around is white and peaceful. Ethereal minimalist style. The 
scene suggests infinite possibility. What you see is what you 
could become.
```

---

## 6. La Source des Halos

```
A gentle point of origin from which soft circles of light 
emanate. Like ripples in still water, but made of luminescence. 
Pale gold and white, expanding outward in peaceful waves. 
Ethereal and dreamlike. A small fox figure approaches, about to 
bathe in the gentle glow. Minimalist illustration, zen 
atmosphere, no harsh lines.
```

---

## 7. Fée-Trait

```
A tiny spark of light, no bigger than a firefly, drawing a 
delicate line as it flies through white space. The line it 
leaves behind glows softly. Ethereal minimalist style. The 
fairy-spark has a joyful energy, moving in gentle curves. 
Dreamlike atmosphere, soft gold on white, a sense of small 
magic happening.
```

---

## 8. Ombre-Douce

```
A soft grey presence in a world of white light. Not dark, not 
threatening - gentle and restful. Like a cloud of calm. A small 
fox sleeps against it, peaceful. The shadow doesn't block light, 
it softens it. Ethereal minimalist illustration, soothing 
palette of whites and pale greys, dreamlike comfort.
```

---

## 9. Souffle-Ancien

```
An invisible presence shown only by the movement it creates. 
Soft lines bending gently as if blown by a thoughtful wind. 
Floating particles shifting direction. No figure visible, just 
the effect of ancient breath moving through luminous space. 
Ethereal minimalist style, white and pale gold, a sense of 
wisdom passing through.
```

---

## 10. La Métamorphose

```
A sequence showing transformation: a fox silhouette slowly 
becoming pure light, then becoming a constellation of points, 
then becoming a flowing form again. All stages visible in one 
ethereal composition. Minimalist style, soft transitions, no 
harsh edges. The beauty of change. Pale gold and white palette, 
dreamlike atmosphere.
```

---

## 11. Les Saisons de Lumière

```
Six gentle circular vignettes arranged in a soft pattern. Each 
shows a different quality of light: dawn-like awakening, bright 
clarity, soft breathing stillness, fluid transformation, warm 
connection between two lights, peaceful rest. Ethereal 
minimalist illustration, pale gold and white, each circle a 
different luminous mood. Zen-inspired simplicity.
```

---

## 12. Le Premier Trait

```
A vast empty white space. In the center, a single delicate line, 
glowing softly with pale gold light. The first mark ever made. 
The beginning of everything. Ethereal minimalist style, 
powerful simplicity, the line seems alive, seems to breathe. 
Around it, the potential for a whole world.
```
