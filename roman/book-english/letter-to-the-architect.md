# A Letter to the Architect of the Web

---

You gave us the infrastructure for documents to find each other.

Now documents are becoming agents. They don't just sit and wait to be read—they act, negotiate, decide. The Web you built was for *exchange*. What comes next requires *coordination*.

This book is an attempt to think through that transition.

---

**The problem, as I see it:**

The Web succeeded because you made the hard choice early: open protocols, no ownership, the commons above the corporation. HTML belongs to no one. HTTP belongs to everyone. That's why it worked.

We are now building systems that act autonomously—software that pursues goals, makes decisions, interacts with other software and with people. And we are building them without shared infrastructure for *trust*.

The current approach is: capability first, trust later (maybe never).

The result is predictable: opacity becomes competitive advantage, accountability dissolves, coordination breaks down. We've seen this before. You saw it before you built the Web.

**What this book proposes:**

Not AI. Not machine learning. Those are components.

The core argument is about *language*, *structure*, and *coordination*—the same concerns that shaped your work, extended into an era where software acts.

Chapter 13 traces the path from representation to execution: from the Web of documents (1.0), through the Semantic Web (your vision for meaning), to what I call the Agentic Web—where software coordinates through shared protocols.

Chapter 14 proposes what might come next: an International Consortium of Trust (ICT), parallel to the W3C, to standardize not documents but *behavior*. Not exchange but *coordination*. Not information but *trust*.

---

**Why I'm writing to you:**

Because you've done this before.

CERN released the Web protocols in 1993. You founded the W3C in 1994. You understood that infrastructure must be a commons.

The same choice exists now, at a deeper level. Someone must give away the trust protocols. The alternative—proprietary trust controlled by a few corporations—would betray the open spirit that made the Web possible.

---

**What I'm asking:**

Only that you read Chapter 13 and Chapter 14.

If the argument makes sense, perhaps there is a conversation to be had. If not, the book stands on its own.

The Web was your first gift.
Open Trust could be the second.
