# A Note on This Work

---

This is not a book about AI.

It is an attempt to extend the logic of the Web—language, standards, public infrastructure—into an era where software executes rather than displays.

The Web solved document exchange. We now face autonomous coordination.

---

**The core question:**

How do we build trust infrastructure for systems that act?

Not proprietary trust. Not platform trust.
Trust as a commons. Trust as protocol.

---

**If this resonates:**

Chapter 13 traces the path: Web 1.0 → Semantic Web → Agentic Web.

Chapter 14 proposes what might follow: an International Consortium of Trust (ICT), parallel to W3C, for coordination standards.
