## Problem Statement

Current AI systems—including large language models—lack a **unified operational language for cognition**. They process inputs reactively without structured intent representation, explicit reasoning phases, or transparent meta-cognitive traces. This limits their capacity for:

- Coherent multi-step planning
- Cross-modal perception integration
- Explainable autonomous action
- Persistent cognitive identity

---

## Proposed Contribution

I propose **UIL (Universal Intent Language)** and **Harmonia**, a cognitive kernel architecture that provides:

1. **A formal Language of Thought grammar** for representing cognitive intent
2. **A four-phase cognitive pipeline (PSMR)**: Perception → Sensemaking → Modeling → Response
3. **A multi-agent orchestration layer** with semantic routing and specialist crews
4. **A transparent execution interface** with real-time cognitive stream visualization

## Core Innovation

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **UIL** | Formal grammar: `IntentFrame = {domain, verb, object, qualifiers, context}` |
| **LUCS** | Unified Cognitive Stream — multimodal input fusion (text, voice, UI events) |
| **Harmonia** | Cognitive kernel with PSMR cycle and semantic agent routing |
| **Thinking Panel** | Meta-reasoning transparency layer for cognitive traces |
| **OutputOS** | Multimodal execution (text, TTS, avatar, UI actions) |
| **Spaces** | Parallel cognitive contexts with isolated goals and memory |

---

## Prototype Status

A working prototype demonstrates the complete cognitive pipeline:

- Real-time intent parsing from natural language
- Automated domain classification and crew activation
- Visible PSMR phase transitions in UI
- Multi-agent specialist coordination
- Voice and avatar output generation

**Demo available upon request.**

## Research Agenda

**Year 1:** Formal semantics of UIL — grammar specification, parsing algorithms, intent taxonomy

**Year 2:** Cognitive graph structures — memory integration, planning representations, world modeling

**Year 3:** Embodied cognition — multimodal agents, action grounding, autonomous loops

---

## Academic Fit

This research bridges:

- **Formal linguistics** (syntax, semantics, pragmatics)
- **Cognitive science** (Language of Thought hypothesis, dual-process theory)
- **AI/ML systems** (LLM orchestration, multi-agent architectures)
- **Human-Computer Interaction** (transparent AI, cognitive UX)

---

## Relevant Background

- MSc equivalent experience in software architecture and AI systems
- 10+ years building complex cognitive-adjacent systems
- Complete working prototype (UIL + Harmonia + LUCS + OutputOS)
- AMI doctoral thesis manuscript (14 chapters, 50,000+ words)
