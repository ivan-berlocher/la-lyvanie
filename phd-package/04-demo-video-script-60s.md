# Demo Video Script — 60 Seconds

## Overview

**Duration:** 60 seconds  
**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover  
**Goal:** Show a working cognitive kernel processing real input through all PSMR phases

---

## Timeline

### 0:00–0:10 — LUCS: Multimodal Input Stream

**Screen:** LUCS interface receiving input

**Voiceover:**
> "LUCS—the Unified Cognitive Stream—receives multimodal inputs: text, voice commands, and UI events. All signals converge into a single cognitive pipeline."

**Show:**

- Text input appearing
- Voice waveform (optional)
- Input being captured in real-time

---

### 0:10–0:20 — UIL: Intent Parsing

**Screen:** UIL parsing visualization

**Voiceover:**
> "UIL—Universal Intent Language—parses raw input into structured intent. Domain, verb, object, and qualifiers are extracted automatically."

**Show:**

- Input: "Create a presentation about cognitive architectures"
- Output: `{domain: "productivity", verb: "create", object: "presentation", topic: "cognitive architectures"}`

---

### 0:20–0:30 — Harmonia: PSMR Cognitive Cycle

**Screen:** Harmonia kernel dashboard

**Voiceover:**
> "Harmonia processes intent through four phases: Perception, Sensemaking, Modeling, and Response. The kernel routes to specialized agents based on semantic analysis."

**Show:**

- PSMR phase indicators lighting up sequentially
- Agent selection happening automatically

---

### 0:30–0:40 — Thinking Panel: Meta-Reasoning

**Screen:** Thinking Panel UI

**Voiceover:**
> "The Thinking Panel provides transparency—showing the system's reasoning steps, active considerations, and decision traces in real-time."

**Show:**

- Meta-reasoning steps appearing
- Visible cognitive trace
- Confidence scores (optional)

---

### 0:40–0:50 — OutputOS: Execution

**Screen:** OutputOS generating output

**Voiceover:**
> "OutputOS executes the response: generating text, synthesizing voice, animating avatar expressions, and triggering UI actions."

**Show:**

- Text generation streaming
- TTS audio playing
- Avatar speaking (if available)

---

### 0:50–0:60 — LifeOS Spaces: Cognitive Graph

**Screen:** Spaces interface

**Voiceover:**
> "LifeOS Spaces maintain parallel cognitive contexts. Each Space—Ivan, Theo, Alex—has its own goals, memory, and active crews. A complete cognitive operating system."

**Show:**

- Multiple Spaces visible
- Cognitive graph connections
- Final title card: "Harmonia Cognitive Kernel — UIL v1.0"

---

## Production Notes

### Technical Requirements

- Screen recording at 1080p minimum
- Clear, professional voiceover (your voice or AI TTS)
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Highlight boxes or arrows for key UI elements

### Music

- Optional subtle background music
- Prefer: ambient, tech-forward, non-distracting

### End Card

```
Harmonia Cognitive Kernel
Universal Intent Language (UIL) v1.0
