**Subject:** PhD Collaboration: Cognitive Architectures and Universal Intent Languages

---

Dear Professor [NAME],

I am writing to inquire about PhD opportunities in your lab, specifically regarding research on **cognitive architectures** and **formal languages for AI reasoning**.

I have developed a working prototype of a cognitive kernel called **Harmonia**, which implements:

1. **UIL (Universal Intent Language)** — a formal grammar for representing cognitive intent
2. **PSMR cognitive pipeline** — Perception → Sensemaking → Modeling → Response
3. **Multi-agent semantic routing** with specialist crews and transparent meta-reasoning

Unlike purely theoretical proposals, I have a **functioning implementation** demonstrating real-time intent parsing, multimodal input fusion, and autonomous execution.

**Key contributions:**

- A formal Language of Thought specification bridging linguistics and AI
- A cognitive kernel architecture with visible reasoning traces
- A prototype showing the complete perception-to-action pipeline

I have attached a one-page research summary and would be happy to share a technical whitepaper or provide a **10-minute live demonstration** at your convenience.

I believe this work aligns with [LAB NAME]'s research on [SPECIFIC TOPIC], and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

**Ivan Berlocher**
