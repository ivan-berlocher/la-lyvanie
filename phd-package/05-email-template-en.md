**Subject:** PhD Collaboration Inquiry — Implemented Cognitive Kernel & Universal Intent Language

*Alternative:* PhD Inquiry — Executable Cognitive Architecture with Formal Intent Language

---

Dear Professor [NAME],

I am reaching out regarding potential PhD collaboration opportunities in your lab, specifically in the area of **cognitive architectures** and **formal representations for AI reasoning**.

I have developed a functioning cognitive kernel, **Harmonia**, which is not a conceptual proposal but an **implemented system currently running end-to-end**.

The system includes:

1. **Universal Intent Language (UIL):** a typed, structured representation of cognitive intent used as an intermediate representation between perception, reasoning, and action.

2. **Cognitive execution pipeline (PSMR):** Perception → Sensemaking → Modeling → Response, implemented as a modular, inspectable pipeline rather than a monolithic model call.

3. **Multi-agent architecture** with specialist agents coordinated through explicit intent routing, arbitration rules, and traceable meta-reasoning.

The prototype demonstrates:

- Real-time intent parsing from multimodal inputs
- Symbolic + neural hybrid reasoning over a graph-based memory
- Autonomous action selection with visible reasoning traces
- Clear separation between kernel logic and LLM inference

**Key contributions:**

- A formal intent representation designed as an **executable intermediate language** rather than a purely linguistic abstraction
- A cognitive kernel architecture **separating reasoning, memory, and model inference**
- An implemented perception-to-action loop that can be **inspected, logged, and evaluated**

I have attached a one-page research summary outlining the architecture and current implementation. I would also be happy to share a technical whitepaper, code excerpts, or provide a short (~10 minute) live demonstration of the system.

I believe this work aligns well with [LAB NAME]'s research on [SPECIFIC TOPIC], and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss whether it could form the basis of a PhD project or research collaboration.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

## Why This Version Works

| Aspect | Old Version | New Version |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| First impression | "PhD applicant with ideas" | "Engineer with running system" |
| Implementation signal | Weak ("working prototype") | Strong ("end-to-end", "inspectable", "logged") |
| LLM differentiation | Implicit | Explicit ("separation from model inference") |
| Risk perception | "Another GPT wrapper?" | "Systematic architecture work" |
| PhD positioning | "I want to research this" | "I want to formalize + evaluate what exists" |
